## üß© Database Design

### 1. Users

- `user_id`, `full_name`, `username`, `email`, `password`
- A user can own multiple properties, make multiple bookings, leave multiple reviews, and make payments.

### 2. Properties

- `property_id`, `title`, `location`, `description`, `owner_id`
- A property is owned by a user, and can have multiple bookings and reviews.

### 3. Bookings

- `booking_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `price`, `user_id`, `property_id`
- A booking is made by a user for a specific property, and may be linked to a payment.

### 4. Reviews

- `review_id`, `comment`, `rate`, `user_id`, `property_id`
- A review is written by a user and associated with a specific property.

### 5. Payments

- `payment_id`, `amount`, `payment_date`, `status`, `booking_id`, `user_id`
- A payment is made by a user and tied to a specific booking.

## üîí API Security

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

Uses **JWT** to verify user identity and enforce access control.  
üîê **Why:** Prevents unauthorized data access and secures user sessions.

### 2. Input Validation

Validates all input types, formats, and ranges to block malicious input.  
üõ°Ô∏è **Why:** Protects against SQL injection, XSS, and data corruption.

### 3. Rate Limiting

Limits the number of requests per user/IP to prevent abuse.  
‚öôÔ∏è **Why:** Prevents brute-force attacks and DoS attempts.

### 4. Secure Headers

Implements HTTP headers like `Content-Security-Policy` and `X-Frame-Options`.  
üß± **Why:** Reduces exposure to XSS, clickjacking, and other web-based attacks.

### 5. HTTPS with SSL/TLS

All traffic is encrypted using HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates.  
üîí **Why:** Ensures confidentiality and integrity of data in transit.

### 6. API Security Testing

Regular testing using tools like **OWASP ZAP** or **Postman Security Tests**.  
üß™ **Why:** Detects vulnerabilities early and ensures system hardening before deployment.
