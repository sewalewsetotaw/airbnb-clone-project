# Feature Breakdown

1. User Management

Handles the creation, updating, listing, and deletion of user accounts. This module also manages user authentication and authorization to ensure secure access to different parts of the platform based on user roles.

2. Property Management

Allows property owners to create, update, list, and delete property listings. This feature ensures that hosts can manage their accommodations effectively, keeping their listings up-to-date and visible to potential guests.

3. Booking System

Enables users to create, update, view, and cancel bookings for available properties. It ensures accurate reservation handling, prevents double-bookings, and manages availability based on check-in/check-out dates.

4. Payment Processing

Manages the secure handling of payments for bookings. This includes payment initiation, tracking transaction status, and ensuring that hosts receive payment for confirmed reservations.

5. Review System

Allows users to leave feedback by creating, editing, viewing, or deleting reviews on properties they’ve stayed at. This helps maintain transparency and trust between users and hosts by showcasing property quality and guest experiences.

# API Security

1. Authentication and Authorization

Authentication verifies the identity of users, while authorization ensures they can only access resources and perform actions permitted by their roles.
We use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to implement stateless, secure authentication across APIs. This prevents unauthorized access and protects private data like user profiles and bookings.

Why it matters:
To protect user accounts, restrict access to sensitive data, and prevent unauthorized actions like deleting listings or accessing payment history.

2. Input Validation

All user inputs are validated for type, format, and range to prevent malicious data injection. For example, numeric inputs are checked for valid ranges, and strings are sanitized.

Why it matters:
Prevents common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and data corruption by ensuring that only safe and expected data is processed.

3. Rate Limiting

Rate limiting restricts how many requests a client can make within a set time period. This helps prevent abuse of the system and brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints.

Why it matters:
Mitigates Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, protects server resources, and enhances platform stability.

4. Secure Headers

HTTP security headers such as Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options will be implemented to strengthen the application against front-end attacks.

Why it matters:
Reduces the risk of clickjacking, content spoofing, and XSS attacks, ensuring safer client-side behavior.

5. HTTPS with SSL/TLS Encryption

All API traffic and web interactions will be secured via HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates, ensuring that data in transit is encrypted and cannot be intercepted.

Why it matters:
Protects sensitive data like login credentials and payment information from eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

6. API Security Testing

Regular automated and manual security testing will be conducted using tools like OWASP ZAP or Postman Security Tests to detect vulnerabilities early.

Why it matters:
Ensures known security issues are identified and mitigated before deployment, reducing the risk of data breaches or exploitation.

# CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD is a key practice in this project, ensuring high code quality, fast delivery, and minimal production issues.

Continuous Integration (CI)

Developers frequently merge code into a shared repository. Each change triggers automated builds and tests—unit, linting, and basic functional tests—ensuring that code changes integrate smoothly and existing functionality remains intact.
This early feedback loop helps catch bugs quickly and maintain a stable codebase.

Continuous Delivery (CD)

CD extends CI by preparing every change for potential release. It simulates a production environment using staging, where integration tests, regression tests, UI tests, and load tests are run.
This helps developers catch environment-specific or integration-related bugs before they reach production. CD ensures that your application is always in a deployable state.

Continuous Deployment

The final stage of the pipeline, Continuous Deployment, automates the release of every successful build to production without manual approval. It eliminates human delays, allowing high-speed delivery of new features and bug fixes.
Since there's no manual gate, it relies on robust test automation and monitoring to ensure reliability and confidence in each release.

Tools and Technologies

    GitHub Actions – Automates building, testing, and deployment workflows.

    Docker & Docker Compose – Provides consistent environments for development, testing, and deployment.

    PostgreSQL & Redis Containers – Used for integration and performance testing.

    Staging Environment – Mirrors production for safe pre-release validation.
