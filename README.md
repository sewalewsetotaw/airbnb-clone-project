## 🧩 Database Design

### 1. Users

- `user_id`, `full_name`, `username`, `email`, `password`
- A user can own multiple properties, make multiple bookings, leave multiple reviews, and make payments.

### 2. Properties

- `property_id`, `title`, `location`, `description`, `owner_id`
- A property is owned by a user, and can have multiple bookings and reviews.

### 3. Bookings

- `booking_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `price`, `user_id`, `property_id`
- A booking is made by a user for a specific property, and may be linked to a payment.

### 4. Reviews

- `review_id`, `comment`, `rate`, `user_id`, `property_id`
- A review is written by a user and associated with a specific property.

### 5. Payments

- `payment_id`, `amount`, `payment_date`, `status`, `booking_id`, `user_id`
- A payment is made by a user and tied to a specific booking.

## ✨ Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management

Handles user registration, login, profile management, and secure access to platform features using role-based authentication.

### 2. Property Management

Enables property owners to create, view, update, and delete property listings, ensuring real-time visibility for guests.

### 3. Booking System

Allows users to book available properties, manage reservation details, and avoid double-booking with date-based availability checks.

### 4. Payment Processing

Facilitates secure financial transactions and stores payment records for both hosts and guests.

### 5. Review System

Enables guests to leave ratings and comments about their stay, helping build credibility and trust on the platform.

## 🔒 API Security

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

Uses **JWT** to verify user identity and enforce access control.  
🔐 **Why:** Prevents unauthorized data access and secures user sessions.

### 2. Input Validation

Validates all input types, formats, and ranges to block malicious input.  
🛡️ **Why:** Protects against SQL injection, XSS, and data corruption.

### 3. Rate Limiting

Limits the number of requests per user/IP to prevent abuse.  
⚙️ **Why:** Prevents brute-force attacks and DoS attempts.

### 4. Secure Headers

Implements HTTP headers like `Content-Security-Policy` and `X-Frame-Options`.  
🧱 **Why:** Reduces exposure to XSS, clickjacking, and other web-based attacks.

### 5. HTTPS with SSL/TLS

All traffic is encrypted using HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates.  
🔒 **Why:** Ensures confidentiality and integrity of data in transit.

### 6. API Security Testing

Regular testing using tools like **OWASP ZAP** or **Postman Security Tests**.  
🧪 **Why:** Detects vulnerabilities early and ensures system hardening before deployment.

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration (CI)

- Frequent code merges trigger **automated builds and tests**.
- Ensures rapid feedback and stable integration of new changes.

### Continuous Delivery (CD)

- Tests in a **staging environment** (UI, integration, regression, load).
- Guarantees that the codebase is always in a deployable state.

### Continuous Deployment

- Automatically pushes successful builds to **production**.
- Eliminates manual steps and enables fast delivery of new features.

### Tools & Technologies

- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD automation for builds, tests, and deployment.
- **Docker & Docker Compose** – Environment consistency across development and production.
- **Redis & PostgreSQL Containers** – For testing integrated services.
- **Staging Environment** – Mirrors production for reliable pre-release validation.
